# Microsoft Internship Project: MIP Delivery Tool 🚀

Welcome to the MIP Delivery Tool project, a part of your summer internship at Microsoft! This tool is designed to streamline the accreditation process for engineers through a user-friendly interface.

## Introduction ℹ️

MIP (Microsoft Internal Platform) is an accreditation system where engineers can complete various paths to achieve accreditation in specific areas. This project aims to facilitate this process by providing a centralized platform for engineers to track their progress and complete their chosen MIP paths efficiently.

## Features ✨

- User authentication: Engineers can register or login to access their MIP profile.
- MIP selection: Upon login, engineers can choose their desired MIP to pursue.
- Path selection: Within each MIP, engineers can select from several paths available.
- Path completion tracking: Progress is automatically updated as engineers complete steps within a path.
- Comprehensive steps: Each path consists of specific steps to guide engineers through the accreditation process.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Node.js**: Backend environment for server-side logic.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, used for routing.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system for data storage.

## Setup Instructions 🚧
